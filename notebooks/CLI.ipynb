    "*A detailed description:*\n",
    "As the name suggests this class is a container for holding statsictical data/information about converations. The basic concept is that it does not know general conversation metadata, since it is only constructed by the messages and the metadata of unique messages (who sent it, what kind of messages is it, when was it sent). This object is created by `MessagingAnalyzer` class by passing in the DataFrame as input. The DataFrame is created from all the conversations that the analyzer holds (remember you can filter them, down to a single conversation). \n",
    "\n",
    "So to sum it up, `MessagingAnalyzer` knows about the channels and all the metadata of the conversations, while `ConversationStats` only knows about the messages themselves.\n",
